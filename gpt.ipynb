mechanism**. Can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights.\n","- There is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.\n","- Each example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never \"talk\" to each other\n","- In an \"encoder\" attention block just delete the single line that does masking with `tril`, allowing all tokens to communicate. This block here is called a \"decoder\" attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modeling.\n","- \"self-attention\" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In \"cross-attention\", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n","- \"Scaled\" attention additional divides `wei` by 1/sqrt(head_size).
